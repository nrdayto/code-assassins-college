          "In the last three years, the most I have enjoyed about the distance learning is its flexibility and convenience. I am able to be a full-time employee as well as a full-time student without any struggles. Online learning is very convenient since you can complete assignments anywhere where there is computer access. So, it saves you the trouble to plan around school if you want to go on vacation or travel to visit family members on important occasions, such as Thanksgiving or Birthdays. Distance learning is a great way to build network connections in your major and to build your communication and interpersonal skills with other classmates. What eased my fears about the online education is the easy navigation panel on Blackboard as well as the help from course instructors and classmates."

          <h3>School Vision, Mission and Goal</h3>
          <h5>CAC Vision Statement</h5>
        <p>
          Graduates of the Code Assassins College (CAC) continually examine what, how, why and who they teach. They embody compassion, empathy and respect for what every individual brings to the learning experience. They believe that all students can learn and that students&comma; learning potential is unknown and not pre-determined. They believe that the goal of the teacher is to develop students&comma; minds as powerful thinkers and problem-solvers. They view education as a profession in which practice and theory interact continually and dynamically to guide curriculum, pedagogy, and educational leadership.
        </p>
        <h5>CAC Mission Statement</h5>
        <p>
          The Code Assassins College prepares highly qualified, caring, and effective educators to meet the needs of students in diverse settings within the State of New York and beyond. We do so by linking theory, scholarship, and social justice. Our programs emphasize equity, academic excellence, reflective practice, curriculum integration, and advocacy. The programs promote meaningful fieldwork in which pre-service and in-service teachers engage with students, families, and other educators within diverse communities. Our students conduct research, understand educational policies, and develop the skills required to meet the needs of all students. Through their courses and fieldwork, our students develop the dispositions that guide and support their teaching and leading.
        </p>
        <h5>CAC Goals</h5>
        <p>
          To actualize our vision and mission, we engage with our students in the classroom and in the field to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Truly listen to one another and see the world from different perspectives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recognize how race, ethnicity, class, gender, family, and context shape human values and experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand the relationship between students&comma; academic achievement and their emotional well-being.
            </li>
            <li>
              Demonstrate dexterity in their use of curriculum theory, pedagogy, and assessment practices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create classroom environments that respect all students and meet the needs of all learners.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct research with students, educators and school communities to generate new knowledge and strategies that contribute to the field.
            </li>
          </ul>
